I represent a time Value of Money where  a series of equal payments or receipts  occurs at evenly spaced intervals. 

The main difference with single cash flow is the introduction of multiple paiement over time, or multiple cashflow.

Leases and rental payments are examples. The payments or receipts occur at the end of each period for an ordinary annuity

We have 5 value: period, present value, future value, interest rate and paiement.
To get the value of one, we must have the remaining 4 filed in.
