Day Count Fraction (DCF) convention describes how accrued interest is calculated on a variety of financial products like bonds, notes, FRAs, Interest rate swaps etc. 

While Interest rates are usually expressed on a per annum basis (reference period = 1 year), the periodic payments are generally due over shorter intervals (monthly, quaterly etc.). 

The Day Count Fraction (DCF), expressed as a number of days in the accrual period divided by the total number of days in the reference (often 360 or 365) period, determines the accrual payment for the period. Different conventions (or rules) determine how number of days are calculated for the accrual and the reference period
