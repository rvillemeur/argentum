API for using Iex data (https://iexcloud.io/)

We calculate message counts by multiplying the type of data object by that data objectâ€™s weight. 
Data objects are commonly understood units, such as a single stock quote, company fundamentals, 
or news headline. Weights are determined by taking two factors into consideration: frequency of distribution 
and acquisition costs. Weighting can be found in the Data Weighting section of each API endpoint.
