Vocabulary:
-----------
* Interest dates: dates when interest is received;
* Interest period: time interval between two interest dates;
* Periodic interest rate: real interest rate per interest period;
* Capitalization: adding interest to the capital;
* Nominal interest rate: This rate, calculated on an annual basis, is used to determine the periodic interest rate. Generally, this is the rate that is published. It should always be accompanied by the type of capitalization. For example, a rate of "8 % capitalized biannually" means that the interest period is half‚Äêyearly, and the periodic interest rate (biannual) is 8 % / 2 = 4 %. The nominal interest rate does not correspond to the effective annual interest rate, unless the capitalization is annual;
* Effective interest rate: effective annual interest rate.

Equivalence of interest rates:
------------------------------
Two rates are said to be equivalent if, for the same initial investment and over the same time interval (one full year, for example), the final value of the investment, calculated with the two interest rates, is equal.


A rate is being nominal when it is accompanied by a capitalization/compounding period.
